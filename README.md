# LibraryManagementIMS
INTRODUCTION
“Library management system version 1.0 “a library
management programme which helps to set a smart
library unlike a classical library in which records were
written on pen and paper. The programme enables the
librarian to do the following functions:
BOOK DATABASE

 ADD BOOK INFO
 MODIFY BOOK INFO
 DELETE BOOK INFO
 DISPLAY BOOK RECORD
 VIEW MEMBER RECORD

MEMBER DATABASE

 MODIFY MEMBER RECORD
 DELETE MEMBER RECORD
 DISPLAY MEMBER RECORD
 ISSUE A BOOK
 RETURN A BOOK

The programme uses binary files to manage and store
data. The add book function allows the librarian to add
new books to the existing lot. The function on its own
generates a unique book id for the new entry which is
used to uniquely identify a book. In the book records,
several fields classify the book based on
author, subject, and publisher and also give the librarian the info of
number of copies in the library. Modify
and deleting records allows the librarian to remove old

books from the database which are no longer present
also modify existing lots. The display function allows the
librarian to view multiple records of the books.
The other data file is dedicated to the users of the
library. This allows the librarian to perform 
important tasks like adding, viewing, modifying, and deleting member records.
Add Member function enables the librarian to add new members to the member data file.
Similarly as in the above case modifying and deleting allow
to remove non-existent records and modify the current
one's View function enables the operator to view a
single as well as multiple records.
The issue function is used to issue a particular book to
the user and return function gives the info about the return.
